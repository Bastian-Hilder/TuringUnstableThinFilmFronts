# Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model

In this repository you find the supplementary code file related to the article "Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model" by Bastian Hilder and Jonas Jansen. The preprint can be found at [arXiv:???](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279).

### Abstract

TODO

### Videos

Here are three examples of moving pattern interfaces constructed in the article. First, an invasion of the pure conduction state by a hexagon pattern.

### pde2path

The data was obtained using the Matlab library [pde2path](https://www.staff.uni-oldenburg.de/hannes.uecker/pde2path/index.html). 

### Instructions

After installing and initializing pde2path, the data is generated by running cmds.m in Matlab. 
There are two implemented ways to save the generated data (by default, both are turned off):
- Changing 'saveFigures' to 1 in cmds.m saves the Matlab-figures of the bifurcation diagram as well as the plots of to solutions (one close to the onset of bifurcation and one close to film rupture) as eps-files. 
- Changing 'saveData' to 1 in cmds.m writes the data points for the bifurcation diagram and the solution graphs to a txt-fille.

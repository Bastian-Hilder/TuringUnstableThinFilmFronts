# Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model

In this repository you find the supplementary code file related to the article "Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model" by Bastian Hilder and Jonas Jansen. The preprint can be found at [arXiv:???](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279).

### Abstract

### Videos

Here are three examples of moving pattern interfaces constructed in the article. First, an invasion of the pure conduction state by a hexagon pattern.

Second, an invasion of down-hexagons by up-hexagons.

Third, a two-stage invasion process consisting of a primary invasion of the pure conduction state by roll waves followed by a secondary invasion of the roll waves by a hexagon pattern.

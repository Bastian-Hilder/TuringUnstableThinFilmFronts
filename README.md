# Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model

In this repository you find the supplementary code files related to the article "Pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in a two-dimensional Bénard--Marangoni model" by Bastian Hilder and Jonas Jansen. The preprint can be found at [arXiv:???](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279).

### Abstract

TODO

### Videos

Here are three examples of moving pattern interfaces constructed in the article. First, an invasion of the pure conduction state by a hexagon pattern.

Second, an invasion of down-hexagons by up-hexagons.

Third, a two-stage invasion process consisting of a primary invasion of the pure conduction state by roll waves followed by a secondary invasion of the roll waves by a hexagon pattern.

The videos are generated with Matlab using the code provided in the folder "videos". There, also the (compressed) videos displayed above can be found.

### Coefficients

The coefficients for the formal amplitude equations (and the reduced equations on the center manifolds) are calculated using the Mathematica Notebook found in the folder "Coefficient-Mathematica". The output of the notebook is also available as pdf and html there.

Please also note that the notebook can be read using the Wolfram Player, which is freely available [here](https://www.wolfram.com/player/?source=nav).

### Coefficient plots

The plots of the coefficients are generated using Python using the files contained in the folder "Coefficients-Plots". The python scripts read in the explicit expressions provided by the Mathematica Notebook, which are also made available in "Coefficients-Plots".

### Phase plane

The phase plane diagrams for the heteroclinic orbits on the reduced system are also generated the streamplot-function provided by Mathematica. The corresponding Mathematica Notebooks for both the square and hexagonal lattice are available in the folder "Phase planes". There, also a pdf version of the outputs of the notebooks can be found.
